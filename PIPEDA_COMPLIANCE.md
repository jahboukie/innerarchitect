4. **Limiting Collection**: We limit the collection of personal information to only what is necessary for the purposes identified.

5. **Limiting Use, Disclosure, and Retention**: We only use or disclose personal information for the purposes for which it was collected, and we only keep it as long as necessary.

6. **Accuracy**: We ensure that personal information is as accurate, complete, and up-to-date as necessary.

7. **Safeguards**: We protect personal information with appropriate security measures.

8. **Openness**: We make information about our privacy policies and practices readily available.
