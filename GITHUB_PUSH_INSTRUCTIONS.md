# GitHub Push Instructions for InnerArchitect

Since direct pushing from this environment requires authentication, here are the steps to push the code to GitHub manually:

## Option 1: Using HTTPS with Personal Access Token

1. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) on GitHub:
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
   - Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a name like "InnerArchitect Push"
   - Select at least the "repo" scope
   - Click "Generate token" and copy the token

2. Clone the repository locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jahboukie/innerarchitect.git
   cd innerarchitect
   ```

3. Copy all files from this environment to your local repository

4. Add, commit, and push the changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: Add internationalization framework and PIPEDA compliance"
   git push origin main
   ```
   When prompted for password, use the Personal Access Token you created.

## Option 2: Using SSH

1. Set up SSH keys if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@email.com"
   ```

   - Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key
   - Copy the contents of `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
   - Paste into GitHub and save
