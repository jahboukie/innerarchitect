## Deployment Information

The application can be deployed using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The CI/CD pipeline automatically deploys:
- To staging when code is pushed to the `development` branch
- To production when code is pushed to the `main` branch

Refer to `CI_CD_DOCUMENTATION.md` for detailed information about the deployment process.
