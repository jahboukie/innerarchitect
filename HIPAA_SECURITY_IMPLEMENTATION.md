# The Inner Architect - HIPAA Security Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of military-grade HIPAA-compliant security features for The Inner Architect platform. As a mental health application dealing with sensitive user data, HIPAA compliance is essential to protect user privacy and maintain regulatory compliance.

## Security Framework Implementation

### 1. Encryption and Data Protection

#### 1.1 Data Encryption at Rest
- **Database Encryption**: All sensitive data in PostgreSQL will be encrypted using AES-256 encryption
- **File System Encryption**: User-generated content and uploaded files will be stored in an encrypted format
- **Secure Key Management**: Implementation of a Hardware Security Module (HSM) for key management
- **Field-Level Encryption**: PHI (Protected Health Information) fields will use additional encryption

```python
# Example implementation of field-level encryption for PHI
class EncryptedField(db.TypeDecorator):
    impl = db.String
    
    def __init__(self, key_provider=None, **kwargs):
        self.key_provider = key_provider or default_key_provider
        super(EncryptedField, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        
    def process_bind_param(self, value, dialect):
        if value is not None:
            encryption_key = self.key_provider.get_key()
            return encrypt_value(value, encryption_key)
        return value
        
    def process_result_value(self, value, dialect):
        if value is not None:
            encryption_key = self.key_provider.get_key()
            return decrypt_value(value, encryption_key)
        return value
```

#### 1.2 Data Encryption in Transit
- **TLS 1.3**: Enforced for all HTTP traffic with strong cipher suites
- **Certificate Pinning**: Implementation for API communications
- **Secure WebSockets**: For real-time communications with encryption
- **API Payload Encryption**: Additional encryption layer for sensitive API payloads

### 2. Authentication and Access Control

#### 2.1 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **Required MFA**: Implementation for all admin users and practitioners
- **Optional MFA**: For regular users with sensitive data
- **MFA Methods**: TOTP-based authenticator apps, SMS, email, and biometric (where available)
- **Adaptive Authentication**: Risk-based MFA triggering

```python
def require_mfa(f):
    """Decorator to require MFA for sensitive operations"""
    @wraps(f)
    def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
        if not current_user.is_authenticated:
            return redirect(url_for('auth.login'))
            
        # Check if user has completed MFA
        if not session.get('mfa_verified') and current_user.mfa_enabled:
            # Store the original destination
            session['next_url'] = request.url
            flash("Additional authentication required for this action.", "info")
            return redirect(url_for('auth.mfa_verify'))
        
        # Check if this is a high-risk operation requiring MFA even for users without MFA enabled
        if is_high_risk_operation() and not session.get('mfa_verified'):
            session['next_url'] = request.url
            flash("This sensitive operation requires additional verification.", "warning")
            return redirect(url_for('auth.mfa_verify'))
            
        return f(*args, **kwargs)
    return decorated_function
```

#### 2.2 Advanced Access Controls
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permissions system
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Context-aware permissions
- **Just-In-Time Access**: Temporary elevated permissions with automatic expiration
- **Break-Glass Protocol**: Emergency access procedures with extensive logging

#### 2.3 Session Management
- **Secure Session Handling**: HTTP-only, secure cookies with SameSite=Strict
- **Session Timeout**: Automatic logout after inactivity (configurable by admin)
- **Concurrent Session Control**: Option to limit to single active session per user
- **Session Monitoring**: Detection of suspicious session activities

### 3. Audit and Monitoring

#### 3.1 Comprehensive Audit Trail
- **Immutable Audit Logs**: Tamper-evident logging for all PHI access and modifications
- **User Activity Tracking**: Detailed logs of all user interactions with sensitive data
- **Admin Activity Monitoring**: Enhanced logging for administrative actions
- **Exportable Audit Reports**: For compliance and investigation purposes

```python
def audit_log(action_type, resource_type, resource_id, details=None):
    """Create an immutable audit log entry"""
    log_entry = AuditLog(
        user_id=current_user.id if current_user.is_authenticated else None,
        action_type=action_type,
        resource_type=resource_type,
        resource_id=resource_id,
        ip_address=request.remote_addr,
        user_agent=request.user_agent.string,
        details=details,
        timestamp=datetime.utcnow()
    )
    
    # Generate a hash of the log entry to ensure immutability
    log_entry.entry_hash = generate_log_hash(log_entry)
    
    db.session.add(log_entry)
    db.session.commit()
    
    # For critical operations, also send to secure external logging service
    if action_type in CRITICAL_ACTIONS:
        send_to_secure_logging_service(log_entry)
```

#### 3.2 Security Monitoring
- **Real-time Threat Detection**: Implementation of WAF and IDS/IPS systems
- **Anomaly Detection**: Machine learning-based detection of unusual patterns

- **Data Flow Mapping**: Documentation of all PHI data flows
- **Data Inventory**: Comprehensive registry of all data storage locations

#### 4.2 Data Retention and Disposal
- **Configurable Retention Policies**: Customizable data retention periods
- **Secure Data Deletion**: Cryptographic erasure for data disposal
- **Automated Archiving**: For data that must be retained but not actively used
- **Deletion Verification**: Audit process to verify complete removal

```python
def secure_delete(model_instance):
    """Perform secure deletion of sensitive data"""
    # First, overwrite sensitive fields with random data
    for field_name in model_instance.__sensitive_fields__:
        setattr(model_instance, field_name, generate_random_data(
            getattr(model_instance.__class__, field_name).type.length
        ))
    
    # Update the database to overwrite the original data
    db.session.add(model_instance)
    db.session.commit()
    
    # Now delete the record
    db.session.delete(model_instance)
    db.session.commit()
    
    # Log the secure deletion
    audit_log('SECURE_DELETE', model_instance.__tablename__, model_instance.id)
```
