 I'll provide a general overview of possible improvements or implementations you could consider based on the current codebase. However, implementing changes will depend on your specific needs and requirements. Here are some suggestions:

Code Structure and Modularity:

Subscription Manager: The subscription_manager.py file handles various tasks like subscription management, payments, and quotas. Consider splitting it into separate modules or classes for handling different tasks like billing, quotas, etc.
Logging: Ensure standardized logging practices across all modules. You can create a dedicated logging configuration file to enforce consistency.
Error Handling Improvements:

Implement more robust error handling for database transactions and external service calls (e.g., Stripe). Utilize retry mechanisms or error notifications to handle transient failures.
User Experience Enhancements:

Frontend: Enhance the user interface for subscription management and user profiles, potentially by integrating interactive dashboards that display recent activities and usage metrics.
Localization: Expanding localization support to additional languages could improve user accessibility globally.
Performance Optimization:

Analyze database queries to improve performance with indexing or query optimizations, especially for frequent queries in high-traffic parts of the application.
API Enhancements:

Version your APIs to ensure backward compatibility as you introduce changes.
Employ rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse and ensure quality of service.
Security Improvements:

Review the app for security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and ensure that user inputs are validated and sanitized appropriately.
Implement HTTPS for secure communications if not already done in production.
Testing:

Expand unit and integration tests to cover more parts of the codebase. Consider including tests for critical functionalities like payment processing, subscription status changes, and usage tracking.
Documentation:

Enhance code comments and documentation, especially for complex business logic, to facilitate easier maintenance and onboarding of new developers.
